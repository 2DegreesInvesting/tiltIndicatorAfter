# tiltIndicatorAfter

The goal of tiltIndicatorAfter is to conduct post-processing of four indicators created from the tiltIndicator package. The post-processing process cleans the data, adds additional columns, and creates subsets for Netherlands and 20 sample companies. The processed output from the tiltIndicatorAfter package is the final output for the user.
