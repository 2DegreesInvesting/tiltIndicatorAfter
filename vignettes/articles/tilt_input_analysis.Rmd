This article is a brief documentation of the methodology and tools that tilt 
provides to analyse the inputs of a company and its supply chain risk. 

The tilt input and supply chain risk analysis is based on the two main 
indicators provided by the tilt methodology and can be either applied to the 
inputs used for producing a product (“Input Analysis”) or to the suppliers from 
which products are purchased (“Supplier Analysis”). 

The two main indicators of the tilt methodology are the relative emission and 
the sector decarbonisation indicator. The relative emission indicator is a proxy 
for the emission intensity of a company’s products in comparison to other 
products and thereby gives an indication of the impact the product has on the 
environment. This indicator uses Life-Cycle-Assessment (LCA) data to match a 
product to their emission footprint and then ranks it in comparison to groups 
of other products. The sector decarbonisation indicator proxies the transition 
pressure a company is facing based on the sector decarbonisation targets for 
its products. This indicator uses sector level climate scenario data mapped to 
the products and thereby provides information on how much a company must 
transition to meet the reduction targets of the sector in which it is active. 
For more details on the methodology of these two indicators, please refer to our 
detailed documentation provided on our online platform which you can access via
[this link](https://www.tiltsmes.org/tilt-under-the-cb-pastax-grant).

## Input Analysis

These two indicators cannot only be applied to the products of a company, but 
also to its inputs, to better understand input-related climate impact and risks. 
For applying it to inputs, we follow the following two steps:

1. We source the input data needed to produce a product in an automated way from 
  Ecoinvent, our LCA data provider. 
2. As a next step, we then apply the indicators to the inputs to receive results 
  for the inputs’ relative emission and sector decarbonisation indicator. 
3. We show results on product-level and aggregate them on company-level.

Below, we show the code used to apply these indicators and a more detailed 
description of each input-level indicator: 

### Input Sector Decarbonisation Indicator

The Input Sector Decarbonisation Indicator assesses the transition pressure of 
the input products based on the sector's decarbonisation targets the input 
product belongs to. This indicator can be aggregated on company level and as 
such inform about the supply chain risk of an SME, based on its inputs' 
transition pressure. The sector emission reduction targets vary across scenarios 
(e.g., WEO NZ 2050 or IPR 1.5 RPS) and the time horizon (e.g., reduction needed 
until 2030 or 2050 to achieve the targets). The input products are sourced from 
the LCA data provider Ecoinvent and consist, for example, of resources, 
packaging materials, energy and enabling services (such as tractor use on farm) 
to produce the product.

After assigning each input product to a tilt subsector, we can map it to a 
scenario sector and thereby derive the sector decarbonisation target. Depending 
on the magnitude of the reduction target, the product is categorised as having a 
low, medium or high reduction target. The categorisation method based on 
thresholds is explained in the [Thresholds](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/tiltIndicator/articles/tiltIndicator.html#thresholds) 
section or in the detailed documentation on our Online Platform (see link in intro).

After assessing the input products for each product, they are aggregated at 
company-level to derive what percentage of the input products required by the 
company to produce its products have high, medium and low sector decarbonisation 
targets. 

NOTE: While the scenario data are freely available, input data from ecoinvent 
are licensed and can therefore not be shown below. Therefore, the calculations 
are based on fake data. If a user has an ecoinvent license to access the real 
data, this code can be used to calculate real results.

Below, the code first loads the input data, and then passes the input data to the
[profile_sector_upstream](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/tiltIndicatorAfter/reference/profile_sector_upstream.html) 
function (from [tiltIndicatorAfter](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/tiltIndicatorAfter)).
At last, this function calculates the indicator's product and company-level 
results.

### Input Relative Emission Indicator 

The Input Relative Emission Indicator assesses the relative emission intensity 
of the input products based on their relative GHG emission footprint in 
comparison to groups of other products (for more information on the different 
groups at disposal, please refer to our detailed documentation on our [online platform](https://www.tiltsmes.org/tilt-under-the-cb-pastax-grant)). 
Input products with a higher emission intensity also face a higher risk from 
climate policy interventions or low-carbon market changes. The input products 
are sourced from the LCA data provider Ecoinvent and consist, for example, of 
resources, packaging materials, energy and enabling services (such as tractor 
use on farm) to produce the product.

After assessing the input products' climate impact based on their emission 
intensity, they are aggregated at the company-level. We derive what percentage 
of the input products have a high, medium and low emission intensity.

NOTE: GHG emission and input data from ecoinvent are licensed and can therefore 
not be shown below. Therefore, the calculations are based on fake data. If a user 
has an ecoinvent license to access the real data, this code can be used to 
calculate real results. 

Below, the code first loads the input data, and then passes the input data to the
[profile_emissions_upstream](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/tiltIndicatorAfter/reference/profile_emissions_upstream.html) 
function (from [tiltIndicatorAfter](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/tiltIndicatorAfter)). 
At last, this function calculates the indicator's product and company-level 
results.

  column_spec(1:13, extra_css = "white-space: nowrap;")
```

## Supply Chain Analysis

In addition to the input-level analysis, the tilt methodology can also be 
applied to the supply chain of a company, to better understand the supply 
chain-related climate impact and risks. For applying the indicators to 
suppliers, the following approach is used in our Supply Chain Risk Model: 

1. We collect information on the supplier of a company from the firm we are 
  analysing. Per supplier, we need information on their address, business type 
  and products. 
2. As a next step, we then apply the indicators to each supplier based on the 
  collected information. 
3. Then, we show the results in a heatmap to show insights on the suppliers’ 
  climate impact and risks at one glance. 

Below, we show the heatmap after applying the relative emission indicator to an 
example set of suppliers. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata", "heatmap.png", package = "tiltIndicatorAfter"))
```

for creating the above heatmap.
